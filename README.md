# Massachusetts Election Shapefiles
These shapefiles were processed by Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) staff, Radcliffe Research Partners, and members of the Voting Rights Data Institute. The Voting Rights Data Institute (VRDI) was a 2018 summer intensive sponsored by MGGG at Tufts and MIT, with major support from a Bose Research Grant at MIT and from the Jonathon M. Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts.

## Sources
The 2012-2016 raw, unprocessed precinct shapefile comes from the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachuestts, William Francis Galvin. The 2002-2010 raw, unprocessed shapefile comes from the [United States Census Bureau](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2012-2010-state-massachusetts-2010-census-voting-district-state-based-vtd) and was sent to MGGG from Secretary Galvin's office. All election data comes from the Secretary of the Commonwealth's [Elections Division](http://electionstats.state.ma.us). 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1). The 2010 census block shapefile and district shapefiles for Massachusetts were downloaded from the US Census Bureauâ€™s [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html). 2000 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org).

## Processing
In order to join election data to the precinct shapefiles, certain pre-processing steps were taken. Certain precincts in the election results csv were aggregated into one precinct to match the shapefile. For example, in the 2012-2016 elections votes in Andover precinct 7 and 7A were aggregated into one precinct, Andover precinct 7. In the 2002-2010 shapefile, Ware precinct 2 and precinct 3 were merged into one precinct. Undefined areas in the 2002-2010 shapefile (meaning areas encompassing only water with zero population) were deleted. Demographic data were aggregated from the census block level and precincts were assigned to districts using [MGGG's proration software](https://github.com/mggg/maup).
